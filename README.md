Egghunters for Windows 11 x64.
All egghunters in this repository have been tested and validated against the Targetserv (Windows 11 x64) Exploitation Training program.
Each of them is provided as a Keystone-based Python3 script allowing you to:
1. Build the assembly very quickly from within Python.
2. Obtain the ready-to-use opcodes hex string.
3. Execute the script (Windows 11 x64 only) to test the egghunter with a dummy shellcode.
